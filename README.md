## End to end Machine learning Project
This repository demonstrates a complete, modular workflow for developing, evaluating, and deploying a machine learning model using modern MLOps principles and AWS services.
It covers every stage from data ingestion to production deployment, with reproducibility and automation as core design goals.

Overview

This project implements an end to end machine learning pipeline that includes

Data ingestion and preprocessing
Feature engineering and data transformation
Model training, evaluation, and selection
Deployment using AWS Elastic Beanstalk and AWS CodePipeline

The goal is to show how to move from raw data to a production ready model using a reproducible and modular architecture that can be adapted to different datasets and use cases.

Prerequisites

Python version 3.8 or newer
AWS credentials configured locally using aws configure
Docker for local containerization if needed
Permissions to access AWS Elastic Beanstalk and AWS CodePipeline

CI CD and MLOps Integration

AWS CodePipeline automates
Code checkout and testing
Model packaging and artifact storage
Deployment to Elastic Beanstalk environments
Monitoring and version control of production models

Future improvements may include
Automatic retraining with AWS Lambda triggers
Data drift and performance monitoring
Dashboard integration using Amazon QuickSight or Streamlit

Reproducibility and Collaboration

All notebooks such as exploration.ipynb and modeling.ipynb document analysis and experimentation.
Datasets are versioned under the data folder.
Automated tests ensure consistent results across environments.
